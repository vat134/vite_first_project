Has  a bug with icons if open from chrome (I tested and open it in firefox)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When creating a branch for design with other UI elements, I did not change the branch in the project during work, and as a result, I have the shadcn-ui design in MAIN. 
And the shadcn-ui branch contains the old version without these elements.
